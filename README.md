Use Amazon S3 as a simple JSON database and serverless API

# About

S3 JSON DB is a simple file-based JSON database for Amazon S3, which also automatically generates a JSON API. It allows you to insert, update, retrieve and delete entries. All entries are stored on S3 as objects in a single json file, so you can easily retrieve them from a Single Page Application or any server-side rendered app. You can use it to quickly prototype a serverless app or backend for your SPA.
